    <h1>Backup Metadata Analyzer</h1>
</div>

![Overview Page](Documentation/overviewPage.png)

## Product Vision
Databackups are an essential functionality for businesses. They ensure, that no important information or artifacts of work is lost due to technical errors or hacking. This metadata analyzer aims to help detect problems or anomalies with backups. This problem detection is done in a timely manor, and in some cases even predictively, to help the customer to react before major damages occur.

## Project Mission
This project aims to explore which data analysis methods are applicable to the backup metadata, which is generated by the industry partnerÂ´s backup software "SESAM". Furthermore, the results of the analysis are condensed into insights and displayed with graphs and alerts. This will help the customer to better understand their backup data and focus on the important take aways.

## Project Structure

![Architecture Diagram](Documentation/architectureDiagram.png)

The project is structured in three modules:
- Frontend
- Backend
- Analyzer

### Frontend
The frontend is developed in TypeScript using Angular and serves to present the analysis of the backup metadata to the user. It includes an overview page for quickly assessing the state of the backups, as well as a detailed backup statistics page and a page for viewing all triggered alerts.

### Backend
The backend is written in TypeScript using NestJS and acts as a bridge between the frontend and the analyzer. Its primary function is to store the results from the analysis module, but it also supports additional features such as sending emails when alerts are triggered.

### Analyzer
The analyzer is implemented in Python and uses Flask to provide REST APIs for updating backend data and managing various analysis modes. Each analysis mode examines a different aspect of the metadata, using custom algorithms to generate alerts whenever irregularities are detected.

TODO: maybe add a section about contributing: protected dev branch, automatic tests using github actions
