![Overview Page](Documentation/overviewPage.png)

## Product Vision
Databackups are an essential functionality for businesses. They ensure, that no important information or artifacts of work is lost due to technical errors or hacking. This metadata analyzer aims to help detect problems or anomalies with backups. This problem detection is done in a timely manor, and in some cases even predictively, to help the customer to react before major damages occur.

## Product Mission
This project aims to explore which data analysis methods are applicable to the backup metadata, which is generated by the industry partnerÂ´s backup software "SESAM". Furthermore, the results of the analysis are condensed into insights and displayed with graphs and alerts. This will help the customer to better understand their backup data and focus on the important take aways.
